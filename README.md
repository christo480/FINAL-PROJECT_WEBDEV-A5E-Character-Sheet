# FINAL PROJECT

## Running this Code

This code requires two node instances to run:
- One runs the express server on the bankend to faciliate requests to MongoDB
- One runs the react js application on the front end to render sheet

### Expanded Content:

- To add more options to the sheet you must add more jsons to the test collection in the test database hosted on MongoDB
- For legal reasons only levelup 5e content in srd and homebrew can be added
